Hello everyone!

This repository contains my exam project in (HTML, CSS, SASS, BOOTSTRAP) from my time studying at LIONSGEEK School.
The project was both fun and challenging, and I learned a lot while building it.

I did my best to complete all the required tasks, even though the time was a bit limited.
It’s not 100% finished yet, but I hope the work I delivered meets the expectations of the coaches.

Thank you for checking out my project!
